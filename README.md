- MVC Paradigm
        MVC stands for Model — View — Controller. It allows a coder to factor out the various components of an application and more easily update them. The MVC allows the programmer to create barriers to organize the code allowing a programmer to compartmentalize functionality.

        Controllers folder contains class files for the controllers. Controllers handles users' request and returns a response. MVC requires the name of all controller files to end with "Controller".
